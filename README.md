# Structogram Designer

## Introduction

This software was written as my BSc thesis. In Structogram Designer,
users can compile different structograms in a GUI, written is JavaFX.
The application contains some basic algorithms as structograms by default,
to improve the workflow (sorting algorithms, maximum selections, etc.).

## Possible user interactions for structograms:
* Save/load (serialization/deserialization)
* Set pre- and postconditions, different types of input arguments, and return type
* Add differend types of commands
  * Variable operations (declaration, definition, assignment)
  * Loops (while, for, foreach)
  * Braching statements (if, switch-case)
  * Jump statements (return, break, continue)
  * Functions (other, previously saved, or default structograms)
* Use in other structograms as functions (recursion is supported as well)
* Generating code in different programming languages
  * Java
  * C++
  * Python

## Usage

Most recommended for educational purposes. The graphical interface can help students
to understand how structograms work, and the code generation shows well,
how different algorithms look in different programming languages.

## Setup
Simply download and run *sdsetup.exe* to install the software on Windows.
